    Overview: [
      `Rajasthan, the Land of Kings, offers a vibrant and deeply cultural experience shaped by centuries of royal heritage, desert landscapes, and diverse traditions. Its cities burst with color — from the pink hues of Jaipur and the blue lanes of Jodhpur to the golden sandstone of Jaisalmer. The state celebrates life with exuberant festivals like Pushkar Fair, Teej, and Gangaur, where locals don traditional attire, perform folk dances like Ghoomar and Kalbelia, and play lively music with instruments like the sarangi and dholak. Every corner showcases rich craftsmanship through intricate textiles, hand-painted pottery, and mirror-work embroidery. 
      Historic forts, majestic palaces, and havelis reflect the grandeur of Rajput architecture, while bustling bazaars overflow with spices, bangles, and Rajasthani cuisine like dal baati churma and ghevar. Rajasthan’s villages and desert camps offer authentic glimpses into rural life, where camel rides, puppet shows, and warm hospitality complete the colorful and cultural tapestry of the state.`,
